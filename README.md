# Javascript Quiz (Current Status: Not Dysfunctional)

## Description

This task has proven to have been more of a challenge than i initially anticipated. 
It doesnt help that I started in the completely wrong direction in reguards to to html elements and storing my questions appropriately, with very little time to work on it.


This is an object version of my questions which would help me go in the right direction. 
I will have to  unfortunately redo this task and reformat all of my files. 


// Questions
var questions = [
    {
      title: "console.log() is a method that prints meassages to where?",
      multiChoice: ["The Html", "The Console", "The Homepage screen", "The root element"],
      answer: "The Console"
    },
  
    {
      title: "Given 'students' is the name of a variable, how would you view its values datatype?",
      multiChoice: ["console.log(typeof students)", "console.log(datatype students)", "datatype.student;", "typeof.students;"],
      answer: "console.log(typeof students)"
    },
  
    {
      title: "To print the 3rd value of the array 'students' in the console, what would you use?",
      multiChoice: ["console.log(studesnts[3])", "console.log(studesnts[2])", "studesnts[2];", "studesnts[3].value;"],
      answer: "console.log(studesnts[2])"
    },
  
    {
      title: "'document.querySelector(< p >)' would do which of the following?",
      multiChoice: ["Change the value of all p elements", "Change the value of the first p element", "Select all p elements in the body", "Select the first p element in the body"],
      answer: ".push()"
    },
  
  ];

## Screenshots

These are two images of my homepage and scoreboard page, I was able to create functioning buttons which displayed the answers on the appropriate buttons, and lead to the next question as writen in the assessment criteria but they ceased to function as selecting an event listener with the format I have used caused some issues. Im not very pleased with the outcome but I have a better insight into appropriate ways to store information.
